RocketLaunchCountdown is a python and HTML system to operate a launch countdown and go/nogo indicator. Currently the go/nogo is operated by a confidential spreadsheet, and thus may not always work. Later on in development there will be the ability to add your own go/nogo indicator or use an inapp system.

Latest release: [RocketLaunchCountdown 0.2.1](https://github.com/HamsterSpaceNerd3000/RocketLaunchCountdown/releases/tag/Prealpha_021)
